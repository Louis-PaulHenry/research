# IEEE Quantum Week Neutral Atom Tutorials

Welcome to the 2022 IEEE Quantum Week tutorial on quantum computing with neutral atoms. Details on the program can be found [here](https://qce.quantum.ieee.org/2022/tutorials-program/). 

In support of the tutorial activities and lectures, QuEra and Pasqal have worked together to provide participants with a couple of hands-on coding tutorial materials. These contain instructions to deploy basic applications using the two current-day main packages for designing algorithms with neutral-atom analog quantum processors: [Bloqade](https://queracomputing.github.io/Bloqade.jl/dev/), and [Pulser](https://pulser.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). 

The tutorials are developed on [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) format and can be found in this repository. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) is recommended. Further instructions for installation and specific dependencties necessary for each activities can be found in the notebooks.
